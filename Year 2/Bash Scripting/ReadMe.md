# Bash scripting Coursework

This Coursework has been assigned as pratical Coursework in Team in the Opeeratying System modules.
I have created this script working with:
* Taylor Courtney 
* Simone Piazzini 

# Goal of the project

Create a script able to emulate he set of commands linked to the crontab command in Unix/Linux systems. 
The user will be able to:
* Add a new crontab job.
* Display crontab jobs (if at least one crontab job has been created).
* Edit a crontab jon.
* Remove a crontab job.
* Remove all the crontab job.
* Validate any user imput.

# My role

I have worked on:
* Design of the script.
* Add job function.
* Coding review of the display function (I have added a user message if the file was empty).
* Buf fixing of the edit job function.
* Write part of the documentation.

# Notes

* Make sure to have the crontab file in the same working directory of the script.
* Make sure that your crontab.sh file is an executable file
* Because the star character is a special character in the shell , write (-1 instead char) when you would like to use it (more details in the documentation.pdf file).

# Documentation
To get any advices to run and use the script please, have a look at the documentation.pdf file.

# Feedback from the Module Leader and Final Grade

Overall, it was a very intuitive script that included all the tasks. It had all the required functionalities as they were requested. Only displaying the jobs could be slightly more human readable. I must complement you for the very well-built menu. The embedded comments and the documentation were just an add-on to an already professional work.

* Points : 39/40 
* Grade  : 97.5%
