# C++ Coursework

This coursework is a new project splitted in two different parts that work together.

We define the first part as PART A, where I have build up a library class that implements a binary search tree
data structure to store the strings inside a .txt file

In the PART B, I have used my binary search tree class to implement a program that counts the frequency of each word in a text file.


For obtain the order, we have to compare the words
using >,< or =. 

For use/test this application you need basically to use gcc/clang or other 
compilers that support c++11.
