This coursework is a new project splitted in two different parts that work together.

We define the first part as PART A, where I have build up a library class that impleemnts a binary search tree
data structure for storing string data for efficient searching.

In the PART B, I have used my binary search tree class to impleemnt 
a program to count the frequency of each word in a text file.


For obtain the order, we have to compare the words
using >,< or =. 

For use/test this application you need basically to use gcc/clang or other 
compilers that support c++11.
