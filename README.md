# university Coursework

This repo contains most of the Coursework that I have created individually or in Team during my Computer Science Degree course at Napier university. 
Few courseworks will not be published until the end of the demonstration of every student of the course to avoid  any plagiarism.

### Contribution with other students

If any coursework has been created in team, all the contributors of the projects will be indicated 
in the documentation of each coursework. 

### Note

All the coursework that needed its own GitHub repository as part of the project specification , are already accessible by Link. 
	Es: WebTech/Coursewor1 -> Contains a Link to the Coursework1 WebTech repository.
